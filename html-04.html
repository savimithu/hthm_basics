    in the Chola Empire and remained its capital till the emergence of Gangaikonda Cholapuram in about 1025. Since then,
    Thanjavur has been one of the chief political, cultural and religious centers of South India. During the first
    decade of the eleventh century, the Chola king Raja Raja Chola I (985-1014) constructed the Brihadeeswarar Temple.
    The temple is considered to be one of the best specimens of South Indian temple architecture.</p>
<P style="font-style:italic;"> Thanjavur is one of the older cities in Tamil Nadu and has a lot of significance in
    Dravidian history. Thanjavur was eventually annexed along with the rest of the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king
    Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I in 1279. Later it went into the hands of Delhi Sultanate from whom Vijayanagara
    rulers have conquered. It was governed by Thanjavur Nayaks under Vijayanagara suzerainty. Thanjavur was successfully
    conquered by Ekoji I in 1674, the Maratha feudatory of the Nawab of Bijapur and half-brother of Shivaji. Ekoji
    founded the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into
    British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II (1832-55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died
    without a male heir.</P>
